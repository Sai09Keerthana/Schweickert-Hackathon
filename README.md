# Schweickert-Hackathon

Schweickert-Hackathon repository

## Api

Python Flask API that talks to Schweikert's iTop OpenSource Support Ticketing Testsystem. It can create a Ticket there.
For deployment we've taken the important pieces and upgraded it to AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda with python. That way it is highly scaleable and a cheap pay per use model.

## Frontend

Written in React.

## DEMO

[Open DEMO](http://codingyourlife-schweickert-eva-frontend.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com)

NOTE: Because this URL is http and not https the record button does not seem to work. It does as in the video.
NOTE: Optimized for desktop browser because record did not work on mobile. Johannes created this [Pull Request](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-mp3-recorder/pull/17)
